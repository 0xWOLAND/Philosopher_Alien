The Brain in a Vat theory, explained and created by Hilary Putnam, argues that we aren’t able to differentiate if we are living in a real reality vs a simulated one. He proposes the idea that our brains could just be inside a vat attached to supercomputers simulating a reality, which we are falsely assuming is the true reality. Putnam’s Brain in a Vat theory is in accordance with the anti-realist perspective.
